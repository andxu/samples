This repo is copied from https://github.com/callicoder/spring-security-react-ant-design-polls-app, with some of my modifications:
1. split into modules
2. use h2 database and initiate a user and poll   
3. remove the request to manifest.json

You can use the user test(password: test123) to test the functionality.
